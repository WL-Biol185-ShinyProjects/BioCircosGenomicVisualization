# BioCircosGenomicVisualization
In the past decade, genetic research has made leaps and bounds towards the formulation of safe protocols for using genomic testing as a treatment option in clinical settings. While these may not yet be realistic for ethical, financial, and administrative reasons, among others, genetic testing has a promising future for specialized medical care. In many disorders, this could be the guiding light towards a cure. 

This proof-of-concept web app offers an approach doctors and other medical professionals could utilize to condense genomic data into an understandable format to inform medical management. Users can upload their own .csv files that hold their gene SNP data and the app will check the file against a list of gene mutations with known disease associations, specifically in various cancers. Users can use the generated BioCircos plot to visualize the location of their own mutations. With this information, the user can take steps towards genetic counselling to see how gene mapping can provide insight for both their present and future medical care. 

To test the app, upload the "patientData.csv" file on the "BioCircos Plot" tab. For direction interpreting the BioCircos plot, see "Interpreting Your Data." For more reading on the potential of genetic testing, see the "Next Steps" and "Documentation" pages.
